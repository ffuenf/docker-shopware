# DISCONTINUED!
While working with docker on OSX hosts has major performance issues we switched to a vagrant-based approach.
Have a look at [shopware-vagrant](https://github.com/ffuenf/shopware-vagrant) for a better approach.

A docker infrastructure providing all tools required for developing shopware projects locally.

Base Image
----------

[ubuntu:xenial](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)

Tools
-----

Tool            | Description 
:-------------- | :------------
ant             | required to configure and build shopware
php7            | required to run shopware
ionCube Loader  | required to run encrypted shopware extensions
composer        | not directly required by Shopware, as the build will also install a local composer for Shopware, but you can also use it to install Shopware via https://packagist.org/packages/shopware/shopware
curl, git, wget | necessary to execute tasks defined in Shopware's build.xml and for composer to install dependencies
openjdk-8-jdk   | required by ant
mysql-client    | required by Shopware's build.xml to connect to the SQL database server located in another docker container
xdebug          | used for debugging PHP

Exposed Ports
-------------

* 80
* 3306 (by db container)

Environment Variables
---------------------

See [.env](.env) for an example.
```
    SHOPWARE_VERSION=5.2.4_b1a52d04c9c8cd60205c181eb7d51aa5a516bff0
    
    SERVERNAME=shopware.example.com
    ADMIN_EMAIL=demo@demo.demo
    
    MYSQL_HOST=db:3306
    MYSQL_PORT=3306
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
    MYSQL_DATABASE=shopware
    MYSQL_USER=shopware
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```
You may overwrite these settings in your project-specific .env.

Docker Compose
--------------

See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for an example implementation.

Project Setup
--------------

You may start a fresh shopware project by including [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and your customized [.env](.env).
Create `public/` as your document root where shopware will initially be installed.

CAUTION! Use [Docker.app](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac) under OSX to properly circumvent any issues with file/folder permissions.

Development
-----------
1. Fork the repository from GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:

        $ git clone git@github.com:USER/docker-shopware.git

3. Create a git branch

        $ git checkout -b my_bug_fix

5. Make your changes/patches/fixes, committing appropriately
7. Push your changes to GitHub
8. Open a Pull Request
